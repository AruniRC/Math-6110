These are my homework solutions from MATH 6110 - Real Analysis at Cornell University taken during the fall 2012 semester. The professor was Strichartz, the textbook was Real Analyis: Measure Theory, Integration, & Hilbert Spaces by Stein and Shakarchi as well as Functional Analysis: An Introduction to Further Topics in Analysis by the same authors.
